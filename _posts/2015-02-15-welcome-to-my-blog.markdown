Hello everyone, even though I know there is nobody here yet ;).

Finally I made it, in the end I have started my own private blog and as you can see I have even written my first blog post. 

The motivation to start this blog was most of all a need of english writing practice but also a need of sharing my knowledge and thoughts. This blog is also to help me organize my knowledge, views and thoughts and to verify them in confrontation with your opinion, whether positive or negative.

Topics of the blog will be related with my profession which I do everyday, which is also one of my passions, and it’s software development. I’ll be writing about how to make good quality software, looking on a whole process from many sides and based on my professional and private experiences. I’m going to present topics related with organisation, cleaness, clarity and performance of code, infrastructure and architecture of software and software development methodologies. Besides, I’ll be writing about my own apps ideas and about progress of their creation, as long as the process starts. Above topics will be described in iOS environment which I’m currently studying profoundly in my job and also at home.

Thanks to some people that blog has been started, for what I’m very grateful. I want to thank  my wife, who is very patient and very forbearing while I spend time on passions instead of my duties. I also want to thank INFULLMOBILE company, where I work now, where people surprise me and inspire me everyday to even greater effort and wider activity. And finally, last, but not least, I want to thank my English teacher, thanks to whom that post was made as my homework, as the beginning of something new to me.

See you on the next post, the next one will be a little more on ;) … .
